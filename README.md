# What is this about?
This repository contains unpublished documentation of the Scrap Mechanic Mod API.

# Repository structure
All relevant information is categorised by game version. The 0.4.x version of the game will only contain information of the most recent 0.4.x update.
This might change in the future, depending when the official API documentation gets updated and what information it will contain.

Since there already is an official documentation for the version 0.3.5, this repository only contains undocumented information of that version. The rest can be found on the [Official API Documentation](https://www.scrapmechanic.com/api/index.html).

# Contributing
